3. Explore code examples to understand implementation details
4. Contribute your own challenges or improvements

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new challenges, improve existing materials, or fix errors:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your improvements

## Branch Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow strategy for this repository:

- `main` - Production-ready code. Protected branch that only accepts merge requests.
- `develop` - Integration branch for features. This is where most pull requests should target.
- `feature/*` - New features or improvements (e.g., `feature/add-eks-notes`).
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-lambda-example`).
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-s3-section`).
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`).
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes for production (e.g., `hotfix/fix-critical-error`).

### Branch Workflow

1. Create a branch from `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes)
2. Work on your changes
3. Submit a pull request back to `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes)
4. After review and approval, your changes will be merged

## Conventional Commits

We use conventional commits to make our commit messages more meaningful and to automate versioning and changelog generation.

- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat: add new code examples for Lambda functions
